Hellos to everyone that is reading this, which is probably an all time zero. I am cpluscodemaster. Which is ironic because I am not relatively experienced in C++.
Although that is bound to change in the future. And by the time anybody reads this I will either be dead or I will be an exceptional C++ programmer.
I like taking care of reptiles. I find them interesting and easy to work with. I also enjoy playing all sports. Any of them. I'm good at all of them except for baseball and football.
Football is not to be confused with the far superior sport, futbol.
